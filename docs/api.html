		<p>ISHML stands for Interactive Story grapH Management Library, but you can call it "Ishmael."  It facilitates the creation of <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/frequently-asked-questions/">interactive fiction</a> in JavaScript and is intended for client-side applications.</p>
		<p>The ISHML library is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">fluent API</a> with straightforwardly named properties and methods, many of which are chainable.</p>
		<p>The library exposes its methods and properties via a global variable, <code>ishml</code>. </p>
		<p>The <code>new</code> operator is optional. ISHML constructors always return a new object instance when called.</p>
		<p>The ISHML library is intended for modern browsers and relies on features of JavaScript found in the ES2016 specification. Particularly, ISHML relies on all modern browsers now <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/#sec-ordinaryownpropertykeys">iterating an object's own enumerable properties</a> by starting with integer keys in numerical order followed by the order in which the properties are created. (Oddly, <code>console.log()</code>, as implemented in browsers, still insists on alphabetizing object properties for your convenience, which is confusing, but harmless.)</p>
