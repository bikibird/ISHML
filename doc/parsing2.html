        <h1>Parsing Tutorial Part Two</h1>
        <p class="lead">Prerequisites: You should have read <a href="parsing.html">Parsing Tutorial Part One</a>.</p>
        <p>This tutorial examines more complex grammars and covers rule cloning, choice rules, and semantic analysis.</p>
        <p>We'll learn by example and create a more complex grammar than the grammar covered in <a href="parsing.html">part one</a>. The grammar will allow parsing of commands that contain a subject, verb, direct object and indirect object. Subject, direct object, and indirect object are optional, but if the indirect object is present, the direct object must be present.  Also, we'll allow direct object and indirect object to appear in either order.  If the indirect object appears first there is no preposition.  If the direct object appears first, there must be a preposition.</p>

            <h2>Rule Cloning</h2>
            <p>Study Code Listing 1. Let's create a <code>nounPhrase</code> rule that we can use in the <code>subject</code>, <code>directObject</code>, and <code>indirectObject</code> rules.  This way we won't repeat ourselves too much and the code will be more readable. You should recognize the code from the <code>nounPhrase</code> rule from <a href="parsing.html">part one</a>.</p>
            <p>(We'll skip over the definition of <code>nounPhrase.semantics</code> for now and come back to it when we discuss semantics.)</p>
            <p>Now that we have a <code>nounPhrase rule</code>, let's look at our root rule, <code>command</code>.  We use <code>.snip()</code> to create sub-rules, <code>subject</code>, <code>verb</code> and <code>object</code>. The <code>verb</code> rule is defined just as it was in <a href="parsing.html">part one</a>. However, the <code>subject</code> rule was created by passing in the <a>nounPhrase</a> as the second argument of <code>.snip()</code>. This creates a deep copy of <code>nounPhrase</code> as the <code>subject</code> rule.</p>
            <h2>Choice Rules</h2>
            <p>The <code>object</code> rule contains the <code>directObject</code> and <code>indirectObject</code>.  By default all sub-rules created with <code>.snip()</code> are treated as a sequence of snippets when parsed. In the resulting syntax tree, all the snippets are child nodes of the parent node.  However, we can change the mode that the parent rule operates under so that it treats the sub-rules as alternatives to choose among.</p>
            <p>The <code>object</code> rule is configured with the <code>mode</code> option set to <code>ISHML.enum.mode.any</code>, which means that the sub-rules of <code>object</code> should be treated as different choices.  Next, we <code>.snip()</code> two sub-rules, which we call <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>. By convention, we list each <code>.snip()</code> on a separate line to visually clue that they are choice sub-rules, not sequence sub-rules.</p>
            <p>The names we give choice sub-rules are unimportant, because in the resulting syntax tree these choice nodes won't be stored under the object node, just the sub-tree generated by the chosen sub-rule. 
            <p>The <code>ISHML.enum.mode.any</code> mode for rules allows the parser to generate alternative interpretations when provided with ambiguous input text.  For example, "take ruby slipper" can be interpreted as "take the slipper to Ruby," or as "take the red slipper." During parsing, rules with the <code>mode</code> option set to <code>ISHML.enum.mode.any</code> will generate an alternative interpretation for each sub-rule that parses sucessfully. (To stop considering choice rules after the first rule that parses successfully, use <code>ISHML.enum.mode.apt</code> and create the choice sub-rules in priority order.)</p>
       

            <h2>Semantics</h2>
            <p>We now have rules that define a syntax tree, this allows to validate input as having the correct phrase structure, or syntax, but the rules, as yet, cannot determine if the input is meaningful or simply well structured nonsense.  For example, "take "</p>

//How do we struture the input text to look similar to this?

command.nounPhrase //non-terminal
commmand.nounPhrase.article // token for "the"
commmand.nounPhrase.adjectives // token for "ruby"
commmand.nounPhrase.noun // token for "slipper"</pre>
            <p>We created tokens in the lexicon, but we also need to define the structure of the syntax tree to be returned after parsing. In ISHML, a plain JavaScript object represents the root of the syntax tree. The object's properties are the child nodes of the tree.  Child nodes may have children of their own. In other words, the value of a property may also be a plain JavaScript object if the property represents a branch of the tree (a <i>non-terminal</i> node.) All branches of the tree eventually end with the actual token(s) in the <i>terminal</i> nodes.</p>
            <p>Let's design syntax tree for a simple command like "take the ruby slipper."  First, we'll snip that command into a verb followed by a noun phrase. Then, we snip the noun phrase into article, adjectives, and noun.</p>

            </pre>
            <p>Now that we know what we are aiming for, we can design the grammar.  A grammar is a set of nested rules that describes the syntax tree to be generated during parsing. The structure of the grammar mirrors the structure of the syntax tree. Rules are, in spirit, a JavaScript adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus–Naur_form">BNF
                notation</a>.</p>
            <p>Study Code Listing 2.  It defines a variable, <code>command</code>, as an <code>ISHML.Rule</code>.  This will be our root rule.  The <code>.snip()</code> method is used to create two sub-rules, <code>verb</code> and <code>nounPhrase</code>. These are also instances of <code>ISHML.Rule</code>. The <code>command.nounPhrase</code> rule is further sub-divided into <code>article</code>, <code>adjective</code>, and <code>noun</code> rules.</p>
            <p>Now that we have a set of nested rules that mirrors the basic structure of the syntax tree we want, we can configure the rules. By default, the rules return one and only one instance of a branch or token. In the case of tokens, the default is to return the next token in the tokenization (token list), regardless of how that token is defined. </p>
            <p>The default a behavior a rule may be modified with the <code>.configure()</code> method. The <code>.configure()</code> method takes an options object as its argument. It is a plain JavaScript object with properties that are the same as the <a href="api.html#rule-non-enum">non-enumerable properties</a> of ISHML.Rule.</p>
            <p>We'll look at just a few of the available options. Study the <a href="api.html#rule">API</a> for more.  Let's start with <code>filter</code>.  Recall that a single lexeme may be defined multiple ways in the lexicon.  When a token is retrieved from the lexicon, the definitions are exposed as an array in the <code>.definitions</code> property of the token. We use the <code>filter</code> option to specify a function that will return <code>true</code> for valid definitions, filtering out the unwanted definitions from the token during parsing.  If the filter returns <code>false</code> for all the definitions of the token, the rule has failed and the input text is not valid. </p>
            <p>The <code>minimum</code> option specifies the mininum number of times to repeat the rule when parsing the input.  It defaults to 1.  Set to 0 to make the rule optional.  The <code>maximum</code> option specifies the maximum number of times to repeat a rule. It defaults to 1.  Set to <code>Infinity</code> to repeat the rule an indefinite number of times.  If the parser is able to repeat a rule anywhere between the <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> inclusively the rule is deemed successful and the input text is accepted as valid.</p>

                        <li>The <code>command.nounPhrase</code> and also <code>command</code> rules are non-terminal rules because they have sub-rules defined for them with <code>.snip()</code>.

            </div>
            <p>Study Code Listing 3. Now that we've gone through the hard work of making a lexicon and grammar, we are ready to define the parser. The constructor for <code>ISHML.Parser</code> takes an options argument.  The lexicon we created in Code Listing 1 is used for the <code>lexicon</code> option and the command rule we created in Code Listing 2 for the <code>grammar</code> option. We are now finally ready to do some parsing.</p>
            <p>Code Listing 4 shows the parser in action. The <code>.analyze()</code> method applies the grammar rule and the lexicon to the input text and returns the result of the parsing. It takes the input text as the first argument.  The second argument is an options object.</p>
            <p>The input text is first tokenized using the lexicon specified when the parser was constructed.  Depending on the lexemes in the lexicon and the content of the input text, it may be possible that tokenizing may result in more than one valid tokenization.  That's OK. The ISHML parser is designed to handle multiple alternative tokenizations.  After tokenization, the grammar rules are applied and the results are returned as a plain JavaScript object. The properies of this object are dependent on the results of tokenization and parsing.</p> 
            <p>If the input text was successfully tokenized and parsed, the <code>.success</code> property has a value of <code>true</code>. The <code>.interpretations</code> property contains an array of <code>ISHML.Interpretation</code>.  The <code>.gist</code> property of each interpretation contains the syntax tree generated from parsing.  The structure of <code>.gist</code> follows the structure of the grammar rule used to create it. The nodes of the syntax tree are
            properties named after the sub-rules that define them. These properties may in turn have other properties defined on
            them all the way down the syntax tree to the terminal nodes of the tree. A terminal property contains the matching token
            for the sub-rule. In the case where a sub-rule defines the maximum number of tokens to match to be more than one, the
            value stored in the terminal property is an array of tokens.  The <code>.remainder</code> property is an empty array because a successful parsing consumes all the tokens in the tokenization.</p>
            <p>If the input text failed tokenization or parsing, the <code>.success</code> property has a value of <code>false</code>.  If tokenization failed, the <code>.tokenizations</code> property contains an array of partial tokenizations, which can be used to give feedback on why and where tokenization failed.  The <code>.interpretations</code> property is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
            <p>If tokenization was successful, but parsing was not, the <code>.tokenizations</code> property is <code>undefined</code> and the <code>.interprations</code> property contains an array of partial interpretations, which can be used to give feedback on why and where parsing failed.
            </p>
            <p>There are many options for <code>.analyze()</code>. We'll just cover a few of them.  See the <a href="api.html#parser-analyze">API</a> for the complete list.</p>
            <p>Example 1 shows the most basic use. By default, the tokenizer expects whitespace between lexemes and ignores it.  In example 2 the <code>separator</code> option has been changed to ignore whitespace and periods.  Any <code>RegExp</code> may be used as a separator. For no separation at all, set the separator to the empty string.</p>
            <p>Example 3 is lexically correct, but syntactically incorrect, due to the doubled verb.  The result is a partial interpretation as discussed above.</p>
            <p>Example 4 is lexically incorrect because "really pretty" is not registered in the lexicon. The result is a partial tokenization as discussed above.</p>

For instance, <code>example5.tokenizations[0].tokens</code> contains an array of tokens for the partially tokenized input text and <code>example5.tokenizations[0].remainder</code> contains the portion of the input text that could not be tokenized.  By the way,  <a href="aph.html#parser"><code>smooth</code> and <code>fuzzy</code></a> options could have been used to handle lexemes not found in lexicon.  The <code>smooth</code> option skips over lexemes not found in the lexcion.  The <code>fuzzy</code> option creates a token with a definition of "fuzz".</li>
