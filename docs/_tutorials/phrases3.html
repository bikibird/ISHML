<h2>Suffixes</h2>	
<p>Modifiers that are methods of text generation functions created by <code>ishml.Phrase</code> are called <b>suffixes</b>.  An unlimited number of suffixes may by chained together with dot notation to apply layer upon layer of modifications. Suffixes are applied from left to right. That is, the suffix closest to the right parenthesis parenthesis or closing backtick is applied to the phrase first. Then the next closest suffix is applied to that result and so on until the beginning of the chain is reached. If a phrase also has prefixes attached, the prefixes are applied first and then the suffixes are applied to the result.</p>
<p> Unlike prefixes, which take a hybrid approach, a suffix is either a method or a <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get"">getter</a>. Suffixes that are methods must take arguments and <b>must</b> include a pair a parentheses.  Others suffixes are defined as getters and the parentheses <b>must</b> be omitted. The use of getters improves code readablity since the phrases aren't cluttered with empty pairs of parentheses.</p>

<p>Listing 1 shows examples of suffixes in use.  An alphabetical list of all built-in suffixes is available in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link api.html %}">API Reference</a>. </p>

<p>The <code>example1</code> phrase demonstratins the <code>.ing</code> suffix, which turns a verb into a gerund.  The <i>en-us.js</i> script extend <code>ishml.Phrase</code> to provide a library of many <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link api.html %}">modern American-English suffixes</a> for nouns, adjectives, and verbs.</p>
<h2>Combining Prefixes and Suffixes</h2>
<p>When a phrase has both prefixes and suffixes attached, the prefixes are applied first and then suffixes are applied to the result.  This sometimes leads to unintended results like <code>example2</code> in the listing above.  Only the last verb has the <q>ing</q> ending applied to it because the phrase was first turned into a list and capitalized before adding <q>ing</q> to the end of of the resulting text. </p>
<p>This behavior may be changed by nesting phrases.  When phrases are nested, the inner phrase is evaluated first and then the outer phrase. The inner, inner phrase of <code>example3</code> first applies <code>.ing</code> to each of the verbs. Once this phrase has been evaulated, the phrase surrounding it turns it into a comma delimited list followed by capitalizing the first letter of result. There are no restrictions on how deeply a phrase may be nested.</p>
<h2>Tag</h2>
<p>We first encountered the <code>.tag()</code> suffix in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _tutorials/phrases1.html#populating %}">part one of this tutorial</a>, where it was used to label inner phrases for data population.  The  <code>.tag()</code> also provides a means of reusing the results of inner phrases in other parts of an outer phrase.  Consider Listing 2 below.</p>
