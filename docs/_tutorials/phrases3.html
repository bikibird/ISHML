<h2>Suffixes</h2>	
<p>Modifiers that are methods of the text generation function created by <code>ishml.Phrase</code> are called <b>suffixes</b>.  An unlimited number of suffixes may by chained together with dot notation to apply layer upon layer of modifications. Suffixes are applied from left to right. That is, the suffix closest to the right parenthesis parenthesis or closing backtick is applied to the phrase first. Then the next closest suffix is applied to that result and so on until the beginning of the chain is reached. If a phrase has prefixes in addition otot suffixes attached, the prefixes are applied first and then the suffixes are applied to the result.  Some suffixes take arguments and must include a pair a parentheses because they are defined as methods of the phrase.  Others suffixes are defined as <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get"">getters</a> and the parentheses must be omitted. (The use of getters improves code readablity since the phrases are less cluttered looking.)</p>

<p>Listing 1 shows examples of suffixes in use.  An alphabetical list of all built-in suffixes is available in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link api.html %}">API Reference</a>. </p>

<p>The <code>example1</code> phrase demonstratins the <code>.ing</code> suffix, which turns a verb into a gerund.  The <i>en-us.js</i> provides many <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link api.html %}">modern American-English suffixes</a> for nouns, adjectives, and verbs.</p>
<h2>Combining Prefixes and Suffixes</h2>
<p>When a phrase has both prefixes and suffixes attached, the prefixes are applied first and then suffixes are applied to the result.  This sometimes leads to unintended results like <code>example2</code> in the listing above.  Only the last verb has the <q>ing</q> ending applied to it because the phrase was first turned into a list and capitalized. Only then was the phrase turned into a gerund by adding <q>ing</q> to the end. </p>
<p>We can overcome this behavior by nesting phrases.  When phrases are nested, the inner phrase is evaluated first and then the outer phrase. The inner, inner phrase of <code>example3</code> first applies <code>.ing</code> to each of the verbs. Once this phrase has been evaulated, the phrase surrounding it turns it into a comma delimited list followed by capitalizing the first letter of result. Phrases may be nested as deeply as needed.</p>
<h2>Tag</h2>
<p>We first encountered the <code>.tag()</code> suffix in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _tutorials/phrases1.html %}">part one of this tutorial</a>.</p>, where it was used in the context of populating phrases and allowing complex data to reach deep into the phrase to reference specific sub-phrases.</p>
