      <p class="lead">ISHML stands for Interactive Story grapH Management Library, but call it "Ishmael." It's a JavaScript library that facilitates writing <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/frequently-asked-questions/">interactive fiction</a> (text adventure) applications for modern web browsers. The ISHML library has straightforwardly named properties and methods, many of which are chainable. Code written with ISHML is highly readable and intuitive.</p>
      <p>Eventually, ISHML will address all aspects of creating interactive fiction. For now, though, ISHML is just a really flexible and powerful parser that integrates easily into your projects.</p>
      <p>It's <a href="https://github.com/bikibird/ishml">open source</a> and licensed under the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bikibird/ishml/master/LICENSE">ISC license.</a></p>
