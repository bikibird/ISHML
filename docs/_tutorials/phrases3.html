<h1>Text generation Part Three</h1>
<p class="lead">Prerequisites: You should have read <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _tutorials/phrases2.html %}">Text Generation Part Two</a>.</p>
<p>The first two parts of this tutorial covered basic text generation.  We are now ready create some more advanced phrases.  </p>	
<h2>Tags</h2>

<p id="tag">The <code>.tag()</code> suffix allows us to attach a name to a phrase.  We first encountered tags in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _tutorials/phrases1.html %}">part one</a>, where they were used to tag phrases for data population.  However, there are other uses for tagged phrases as well. Sub-phrases that are tagged with a name can be reused in a containing phrase and also provides access to additional properties for the sub-phrase. Examine the JavaScript in listing 1 below.</p>

<span class="badge badge-info">Listing 1</span>

<p>Tagged phrases are available for reuse via the <code>.tags</code> prefix.</p>

<p>The first sub-phrase of <code>example1</code> is tagged as <q>pet</q> In the second sub-phrase, <code>_.a.tags.pet</code> is used to refer to the sub-phrase tagged as <q>pet</q>. The <code>.tags</code> prefix provides access to the collection of tagged phrases and it must be followed by the name of the sub-phrase.  The <code>.a</code> prefix adds the appropriate indefinite article to the sub-phrase.  During text generation a new (and different) animal will be picked at random for each of the two sub-phrases.</p> 

<p>Sometimes when referring to a tagged phrase, we don't want to generate entirely new text; we just want repeat the same text that was already generated in an earlier sub-phrase. The third expression in <code>exammple1</code> is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow funciton</a>.  Whenever a function is encountered during text generation, the function is called with the tags collection as its argument.  This gives the function access to the tagged phrases.  In this case the text property of the <q>pet</q> sub-phrase is returned.</p>

<p>Study <code>example2</code>. The <q>pet</q> tag refers to the whole phrase, <code>_.a.pick()</code>, which first picks an item and then adds an indefinite article.  When the <q>pet</q> phrase is populated, the data needs to go to the inner <code>.pick</code> phrase, not the outer <code>.a</code> phrase, but the tag refers to the phrase as a whole with both prefixes applied. This is not a cause for concern, however, because <code>.populate()</code> will always identify the innermost (terminal) phrase of a tagged phrase and deposit the data there.
<p>We can reference the data associated with the phrase by using the <code>.data</code> property.  Here, <code>tags=>pet.data.problem</code> returns the problem associated with the selected pet and <code>tags=>tags.pet.data.value</code> returns the primary data associated with the <q>pet</q> phrase, in this case the selected animal with an indefinite article prepended. In this instance <code>.data.value</code> and <code>.data.animal</code> are equivalent.  This is due to how <code>.populate()</code> works. If the incoming data object does not explicitly have a <code>.value</code> property, it will be created for the phrase and set to the first property of the incoming data object.</p>
<p id="inner">We can also reference the inner <code>.pick</code> phrase of the <q>pet</q> phrase in <code>example2</code> by using the <code>inner</code> suffix: <code>tags=>tags.pet.inner.data.value</code>. We can chain as many <code>.inner</code> properties as needed to reach a deeply nested phrase.</p>  
<p>Alternatively, we can use parentheses to nest phrases and create tags at different levels of nesting. This is shown in <code>example3</code></p>
<h2>Metadata</h2>
<p>Some prefixes expose additional metadata. The <code>.index</code> and <code>.total</code> metadata are available for <code>.cycle</code>, <code>.favor</code>, <code>.first</code>, <code>.last</code>, <code>.pick</code>, <code>.roll</code>, and <code>.series</code>.  The <code>.total</code> property is the length of a phrases array of sub-phrases. The <code>.index</code> property is the index number of the selected sub-phrase and is zero based.  Listing 2 shows examples of using metadata. </p>

<p>The <code>.series</code> property requires some special handling when accessing metadata.  Once the entries in the series are depleted, the series returns an empty array for the results and there are no items of metadata to access.  Attempting to access non-existent properties will cause an error.  Therefore, we can only access the metadata under certain conditions.  Examine <code>example2</code> in the listing above. The <code>.also</code> suffix signals the start of another <code>ishml.Phrase</code> that will only be evaluated and appended if the preceding phrase returned at least one result. If the preceding series is depleted, the phrase associated with <code>.also</code> will be skipped. Like <code>.then</code>, it is acceptable to chain prefixes after <code>.also</code>.</p>
<h2>Per</h2>
<p id="per">The <code>.per</code> suffix repeats a phrase for as many entries as there are in the referenced tagged phrase. Use it whenever you want to iterated through the array of sub-phrases. See listing 3 below.</p>

<h2 id="concur">Concur</h2>
<p>The <code>.concur</code> suffix filters a set of sub-phrases so that it conforms to the criteria of a provided rule. See listing 4 below.</p>
<span class="badge badge-info">Listing 4</span>
<iframe id="listing4" width="100%" height="575" scrolling="no" src="//jsfiddle.net/bikibird/2ohgukb9/embedded/js,result/?fontColor=ffffff&menuColor=17a2b8" frameborder="0" class="rounded shadow wrap" title="Listing 4"></iframe>
<p>The <code>example1</code> phrase picks a hobby for each person based on their interest.  To filter the possible hobbies by those that match the person's intersest, we add the <code>.concur</code> suffix to the <q>hobby</q> sub-phrase.  The rule function returns true if the hobby matches the persons interest or false if it does not. This function receives the tags collection as its first parameter and the result of each sub-phrase evalution of the targeted phrase as the second parameter.  sub-phrases that do not meet the criteria are removed from consideration before <code>.pick</code> is applied.</p>
