<p>We are now ready to look at phrase factories and tackle recursion.</p>	
<h2>Phrase Factories</h2>

<p>A phrase factory is a function that generates a new instance of <code>ishml.Phrase</code>. The <code>ishml.Template</code> object and its many prefixes are phrase factories. The suffixes of <code>ishml.Phrase</code> are phrase factories. However, not all methods of <code>ishml.Phrase</code> are phrase factory.  Some merely return the existing phrase rather than a new instance.  Take a look at listing 1.</p>

<span class="badge badge-info">Listing 1</span>
<iframe id="listing1" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" src="//jsfiddle.net/bikibird/d5a023vc/embedded/js,result/?fontColor=ffffff&menuColor=17a2b8" frameborder="0" class="rounded shadow wrap" title="Listing 1"></iframe>

<p>Here an attempt was made to create new phrases from the <code>animal</code> phrase.  It does not work because <code>.populate()</code> merely returns the original animal phrase with new data and does not generate a new phrase. As a result, both <code>example1</code> and <code>example2</code> refer to the same instance of <code>ishml.Phrase </code> that <code>animal</code> does.  Instead of producing an amphibian and a rodent respectively, the examples both produce rodents because that was the last set of data populated.</p>

<p>Listing two below demonstrates how to properly create a phrase factory. Here <code>example1</code>and <code>example2</code> reference separate instances of <code>ishml.Phrase</code> and act independently of each other.</p>

<p>A phrase factory is made by simply creating a function that returns new instance of <code>ishml.Phrase</code>. Phrase factories are very useful for recursive phrases. They may also be used to extend <code>ishml.Template</code> and <code>ishml.Phrase</code> as we shall see in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _tutorials/phrases5.html %}">part five</a>.</p>
<h2>Recursion</h2>
<p>In <code>example1</code> of listing 3 below, we see a simple, non-recursive phrase for generating an unordered HTML list.  This is fine as far is it goes, but it would be more useful if it automatically genereated sub-lists on demand to display deeply nested data.  Recursion is used in <code>example2</code> to provide a nested list that expands indefinitely to accomodate on the data provided.</p>

<span class="badge badge-info">Listing 3</span>
<iframe id="listing3" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" src="//jsfiddle.net/bikibird/1anfe392/embedded/js,result/?fontColor=ffffff&menuColor=17a2b8" frameborder="0" class="rounded shadow wrap" title="Listing 3"></iframe>

<p>A phrase factory function is assigned to the variable <code>ul</code>.  The phrase generated by this function also includes a call to this phrase factory function, making it recursive.  The second expression in the phrase checks to see if <code>.list</code> is present in  the <code>data</code> collection.  If it is, the data associated with <code>.list</code> is passed in the call to <code>ul</code>.  This embeds a new instance of the phrase inside phrase.  This will continue recursively as long as <code>.list</code> data is present.  If it is not present, the expression evaluates to an empty string.  When writing recursive functions you must always ensure that there is always a way for the recursion to end, otherwise you will generate a stack overflow error. </p>

<p>List 4 shows another example of a recursive phrase. </p>

<p>The phrase factory, <code>inside</code> creates a phrase about opening a random number of containers, each inside the other and eventually revealing a treasure of some sort.  This function is called recursively as long as the result of <code></code>_.favor(...)</code> is a container.</p>
<h2>Modifying and Extending</h2>
We have now covered the basics of ISHML's phrases and templates and introduced most of built-in prefixes and suffixes, which should cover the majority of your text generation needs. Occasionally, you may want to use a custom function to modify the results of a phrase.  Listing 5 introduces the <code>.modify</code> suffix.
