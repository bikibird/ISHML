        <h1>Parsing Tutorial Part One</h1>
        <p class="lead">Prerequisites: You should have a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">basic working knowledge</a> of JavaScript and HTML and have read about <a href="index.html">getting started</a>.</p>
        <p>The ISHML parser is a recursive descent parser with backtracking, which is capable of returning multiple interpretation of an input text. This tutorial provides an introduction to parsing with ISHML.</p>
        <p>At the heart of it, parsing is about breaking up a larger piece of text into smaller pieces of text and organizing those small pieces in some manner so that they can be used by an application.  The smallest possible unit of meaningful text is called a <i>lexeme</i>. A lexeme is often a single word, but might be as small as a single character, or might be a longer string containing spaces.  A lexeme along with its definition is called a <i>token</i>. A <i>syntax tree</i>, also sometimes called a <i>parse tree</i>, orgainzes the tokens into a hierarchical structure according to a set of rules called a <i>grammar</i>. If this sounds like diagramming a sentence, you have the right idea.</p>
        <p>Analyzing text is a multi-step process.  The first step, called <i>lexing</i> or <i>tokenization</i>, breaks up the input text into an array of tokens. The second step, <i>syntactic analysis</i>, applies grammar rules to the tokenization, which results in a syntax tree.  The third step, <i>semantic analysis</i>, modifies the branches of the syntax tree to change results that are syntactically correct, but not meaningful, into something meaningful, or to discard non-meaningful alternatives.</p>
        <p>Now that we have a general notion of parsing, let's look at parsing in the context of the ISHML API. The API exposes its methods and properties via a global variable, ISHML.  This tutorial will examine  four ISHML objects: <code>.Lexicon</code>, <code>.Rule</code>, <code>.Parser</code>, and <code>.Interpretation</code>.</p> 
        <h2>The Lexicon</h2>
        <p class="lead">Note: All code listings are included as scripts for this web page which you may examine and interact with through your <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">browser's developer tools</a>.</p>
        <p>Let's start by defining a collection of tokens to match against the input text. This is done be creating a lexicon and registering some tokens.  Think of the lexicon as a dictionary. Each entry in a dictionary consists of a word and one or more definitions. Each entry in the lexicon is a lexeme paired with one or more definitions.  Just as synonyms are allowed in a dictionary, multiple lexemes may share the same definition.</p>

            <p>Study Code Listing 1. The first line creates an instance of ISHML.Lexicon. Notice that the <code>new</code> operator is omitted. The new operator is optional. ISHML constructors always return a new object instance when called.</p>
            <p>To add a token to the lexicon, the <code>.register()</code> method is used. The <code>.register()</code> method takes one or more lexemes as its arguments and returns the <code>.as()</code> function. The <code>.as() </code>function argument is the definition of the lexeme(s) and may be anything&mdash; a simple value or complex object. The <code>.as()</code> function returns the instance of the lexicon so that you can chain the <code>.register()</code> method multiple times.</p>
            <p>The definition should be thought of as an arbitrary payload to be retrieved when the lexeme is matched. The definitions in Code Listing 1 are highly simplified.  <span class="font-weight-bold">In practice, a definition will typically hold one or more references to objects and functions from your application.</span> </p>
            <p>Knowing how to register tokens is all you need to know about the lexicon for most parsing applications.  However, the <a href="api.html#lexicon">API</a> discusses many additional features for other, more advanced uses of the lexicon.</p>

//How do we struture the input text to look similar to this?
command //root of syntax tree (JavaScript object)
command.verb //token for "take"
command.nounPhrase //non-terminal
commmand.nounPhrase.article // token for "the"
commmand.nounPhrase.adjectives // token for "ruby"
commmand.nounPhrase.noun // token for "slipper"</pre>
            <p>We created tokens in the lexicon, but we also need to define the structure of the syntax tree to be returned after parsing. In ISHML, a plain JavaScript object represents the root of the syntax tree. The object's properties are the child nodes of the tree.  Child nodes may have children of their own. In other words, the value of a property may also be a plain JavaScript object if the property represents a branch of the tree (a <i>non-terminal</i> node.) All branches of the tree eventually end with the actual token(s) in the <i>terminal</i> nodes.</p>
            <p>Let's design a syntax tree for a simple command like "take the ruby slipper."  First, we snip that command into a verb followed by a noun phrase. Then, we snip the noun phrase into article, adjectives, and noun.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix">

//Code Listing 2

//Create a set of nested rules which mirror the wanted syntax tree.
var command = ISHML.Rule()
command.snip("verb").snip("nounPhrase")
command.nounPhrase.snip("article").snip("adjectives").snip("noun")

//Configure behavior of some of the rules with .configure().

command.verb.configure({ filter: (definition) => definition.part === "verb" })

.configure({ minimum: 0, filter: (definition) => definition.part === "article" })

})

//alternatively the rule's options may be set directly.
command.nounPhrase.noun.filter=(definition) => definition.part === "noun"
            </pre>
            <p>Now that we know what we are aiming for, we can design the grammar.  A grammar is a set of nested rules that describes the syntax tree to be generated during parsing. The structure of the grammar mirrors the structure of the syntax tree. Rules are, in spirit, a JavaScript adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus–Naur_form">BNF
                notation</a>.</p>
            <p>Study Code Listing 2.  It defines a variable, <code>command</code>, as an <code>ISHML.Rule</code>.  This is the root rule.  The <code>.snip()</code> method creates two sub-rules, <code>verb</code> and <code>nounPhrase</code>. These are also instances of <code>ISHML.Rule</code>. The <code>command.nounPhrase</code> rule further sub-divides into <code>article</code>, <code>adjective</code>, and <code>noun</code> rules.</p>
            <p>Now that we have a set of nested rules that mirrors the basic structure of the syntax tree we want, we can configure the rules. By default, rules return exactly one instance of a branch or token for a given interpretation. In the case of tokens, the default is to return the next token in the tokenization (token list), regardless of how that token is defined. </p>
            <p>The default behavior of a rule may be modified with the <code>.configure()</code> method. The <code>.configure()</code> method takes an options object as its argument. It is a plain JavaScript object with properties that are the same as the <a href="api.html#rule-non-enum">non-enumerable properties</a> of ISHML.Rule.</p>
            <p>We'll look at just a few of the available options. Check the <a href="api.html#rule">API</a> for more.  Let's start with <code>filter</code>.  Recall that a single lexeme may have multiple definitions in the lexicon.  When a token is retrieved from the lexicon, the definitions are exposed as an array in the <code>.definitions</code> property of the token. We use the <code>filter</code> option to specify a function that will return <code>true</code> for valid definitions and <code>false</code> for invalid definitions. This will filter out the definitions that do not apply in the context of the grammar rule. If the filter returns <code>false</code> for all the definitions of the token, the token is undefined in the context of the rule and the current interpretation is not valid. </p>
            <p>The <code>minimum</code> option specifies the mininum number of times to repeat the rule when parsing the input.  It defaults to 1.  Set to 0 to make the rule optional.  The <code>maximum</code> option specifies the maximum number of times to repeat a rule. It defaults to 1.  Set it to <code>Infinity</code> to repeat the rule an indefinite number of times.  If the parser is able to repeat a rule any number of times between the <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> inclusively the rule is deemed successful and the interpretation is accepted as valid.</p>

The more accurate answer is that root rule can be any rule that we use to configure the parser, but we haven't talked about that yet...</li>
                        <li>The <code>command.nounPhrase</code> and also <code>command</code> rules are non-terminal rules because they have sub-rules defined for them with <code>.snip()</code>.  The other rules are not "snipped" and therefore are terminal rules. The output of a non-terminal rule is a branch of the syntax tree.  The output of a terminal rule is one or more tokens.</li>

                        <li>Either way works, but using <code>.configure()</code> lets you set multiple options in one statement.  It also returns the instance of <code>ISHML.Rule</code> so you can use method chaining.</li>

</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Study Code Listing 3. Now that we've gone through the hard work of making a lexicon and a grammar, we are ready to define the parser. The constructor for <code>ISHML.Parser</code> takes an options argument.  The lexicon from Code Listing 1 is used for the <code>lexicon</code> option and the command rule from  Code Listing 2  is used for the <code>grammar</code> option. We are now finally ready to do some parsing.</p>
            <p>Code Listing 4 shows the parser in action. The <code>.analyze()</code> method applies the grammar rule and the lexicon to the input text and returns the result of the parsing. It takes the input text as the first argument.  The second argument is an options object.</p>
            <p>The input text is first tokenized using the lexicon specified when the parser was constructed.  Depending on the lexemes in the lexicon and the content of the input text, it may be possible that tokenizing may result in more than one valid tokenization.  That's OK. The ISHML parser is designed to handle multiple alternative tokenizations.  After tokenization, the grammar rules are applied and the results are returned as a plain JavaScript object. The properies of this object are dependent on the results of tokenization and parsing.</p> 
            <p>If the input text was successfully tokenized and parsed, the <code>.success</code> property has a value of <code>true</code>. The <code>.interpretations</code> property contains an array of <code>ISHML.Interpretation</code>.  The <code>.gist</code> property of each interpretation contains the syntax tree generated from parsing.  The structure of <code>.gist</code> follows the structure of the grammar rules used to create it. The nodes of the syntax tree are properties named after the sub-rules that define them. These properties may in turn have other properties defined on them all the way down the syntax tree to the terminal nodes of the tree. A terminal property contains the matching token for the sub-rule. In the case where a sub-rule defines the maximum number of tokens to match to be more than one, the value stored in the terminal property is an array of tokens.  The <code>.remainder</code> property of an interpretation is an empty array because a successful parsing consumes all the tokens in the tokenization.</p>
            <p>If the input text failed tokenization or parsing, the <code>.success</code> property has a value of <code>false</code>.  If tokenization failed, the <code>.tokenizations</code> property contains an array of partial tokenizations, which can be used to give feedback on why and where tokenization failed.  The <code>.interpretations</code> property is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
            <p>If tokenization was successful, but parsing was not, the <code>.tokenizations</code> property is <code>undefined</code> and the <code>.interprations</code> property contains an array of partial interpretations, which can be used to give feedback on why and where parsing failed. A partial interpretation is an interpretation that parses successfully against the grammar, but does not consume all the tokens in the tokenization.
            </p>
            <p>There are many options for <code>.analyze()</code>. We'll only cover a few of them.  See the <a href="api.html#parser-analyze">API</a> for the complete list.</p>
            <p>Example 1 shows the most basic use. By default, the tokenizer expects whitespace between lexemes and ignores it.  In example 2 the <code>separator</code> option has been changed to ignore both whitespace and periods.  Any <code>RegExp</code> may be used as a separator. For no separation at all, set the separator to the empty string.</p>
            <p>Example 3 is lexically correct, but syntactically incorrect due to the doubled verb. No interpretation can be generated. Example 4, with the second instance of "take" moved to the end, results in a partial interpretation since it is syntactically correct if the last token is not considered.</p>
            <p>Example 5 is lexically incorrect because "really pretty" is not registered in the lexicon. The result is a partial tokenization.</p>

For instance, <code>example5.tokenizations[0].tokens</code> contains an array of tokens for the partially tokenized input text and <code>example5.tokenizations[0].remainder</code> contains the portion of the input text that could not be tokenized.  By the way,  <a href="aph.html#parser"><code>smooth</code> and <code>fuzzy</code></a> options could have been used to handle lexemes not found in lexicon.  The <code>smooth</code> option skips over lexemes not found in the lexcion.  The <code>fuzzy</code> option creates a token with a definition of "fuzz".</li>
